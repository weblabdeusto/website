            <p><b>Description</b></p>
            <p>The Go-Lab Project (Global Online Science Labs for Inquiry Learning at School) is a European collaborative project co-funded by the European Commission (Seventh Framework Programme) and uniting 19 organisations from twelve countries. Go-Lab concentrates on providing access to online laboratories in order to enrich classroom experience in schools as well as learning activities out-of-class. The overall aim of the Go-Lab Project is to provide students an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in science by conducting experiments using modern laboratory equipment by themselves, deepen their knowledge in fundamental sciences, and to motivate them for making scientific carrier in the future.</p>

            <p><b>Description</b></p>
            <p>In this catalytic project, the Center for Educational Computing Initiatives at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is partnering with the Spanish University of Distance Education (UNED) and the University of Deusto, Spain. The first goal is the expansion and integration of MIT?s iLabs Shared Architecture (ISA) with an open source learning management system (LMS) using SCORM standards. The coupling of online labs with LMSs will allow a particular experiment to be customized for multiple educational environments and for the learning objectives of the lab experience to be carefully tracked and evaluated. The second goal is to develop a specification for interoperability between two remote lab architectures (ISA &amp; WebLab-Deusto) and create a plan for infrastructure changes to both architectures to enable interoperability and develop a proof of concept implementation. The increased interoperability between different online lab architectures and learning management systems will both lead to an increasing scalable ecology of online labs.</p>
