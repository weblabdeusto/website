            <h2>FPGA</h2>
            <p>ud-fpga lets you remotely practise with a Field Programmable Gate Array. Through the Xilinx software, you can write a FPGA program locally as you normally would. Once the program is compiled, and ready to be tested, you should simply upload the binary ".bit" file through the experiment.</p>

            <p>ud-fpga will automatically program the FPGA board with the binary you provided, and start running it. To see the results, a Webcam is of course provided. You may also interact with the board remotely, by using the provided widgets. Though the widgets themselves might appear artificial, they will send a signal to the board just like their physical counterparts would.</p>

            <p>However, due to certain safety concerns, in the demo version you can't upload your own file for this demo. Instead, a specific demo program (which has already been uploaded) will be used. Everything else will work as in the standard FPGA experiment.</p>

            <p><b>Target audience:</b> Electronics Engineering students.</p>

            <p>ud-demo-pld lets you remotely practise with a Programmable Logic Device.</p>

            <p>With the standard PLD experiment, through the Xilinx software you can write a PLD program locally as you normally would. Once the program is compiled, and ready to be tested, you can simply upload the binary ".jed" file, and it will be programmed on the physical board and run.</p>

            <p>However, due to certain safety concerns, you can’t upload your own file for this demo. Instead, a specific demo program (which has already been uploaded) will be used. Everything else will work as in the standard FPGA experiment.</p>

            <p>That binary file will be automatically programmed into the board, and it will start running. To see the results, a Webcam is provided. You may also interact with the board remotely, by using the provided widgets. Though the widgets themselves might appear artificial, they will send a signal to the board just like their physical counterparts would.</p>

            <p>As the FPGA, the CPLD laboratory is running in the WebLab-Box. However, two different laboratories are available. The queue of students is balanced between both copies, so it goes twice faster.</p>
